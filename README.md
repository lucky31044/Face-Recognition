# Face-recognizer-using-pre-trained-model
Real time face recognizer using transfer learning.

This the implimentation of FaceRecognizer using transfer learning.
There are two steps in
### 1] Face Detection
Face Detection is done by using OpenCV Haar Cascade model.
### 2] Face Recognition
It is done by VGG Face model.

### Features 
- Can recognize multiple face in one frame.
- Realtime.
- No need to train model to add new faces .
